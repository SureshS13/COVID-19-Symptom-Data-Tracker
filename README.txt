README File to aid in using our final application build - "COVID Symptom Tracker.jar"


1. Unless you are on campus, the UWW VPN must be on for the application to run

2. The username and password is "username" and "password" (I understand that its not secure or ideal in the slightest, but during the creation of the front-end I wanted something quick and memorable when debugging and testing).

3. When querying and making changes to data, be aware that you are actively changing the data stored on Sachin's MySQL Washington database tables.

If any additional questions on the design & use of the front-end of our application, don't hesitate to reach out.
